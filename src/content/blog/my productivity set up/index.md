i do not follow any productivity hack or use specific set of tools to stay productive but here is how i roughly operate myself:

1. i walk on every occasion, it helps me to clear my head or inject something that i need.

2. i use a pencil and an unruled diary for clear thinking.

3. i sleep a lot, 7-8 hours a day— sleeping works like preparation for the next day to me but if i'm late to bed that does not mean i'll wake up late and start my day.

4. i read a page or two of a book or do a 10 min morning stretch (yoga) after waking up, it helps me prepare focus.

5. i take a cold shower every morning— that's when i start to get into the flow state, my clothes are all same so i don't have to think what to wear i slowly dive into the flow state of the day as i put on my fresh socks, fold my pant, wear my black analog watch and put on my glasses and adjust it with my index finger (i use two pairs of glasses, if you see me i'm wearing the black one— i'm in a mood to get shit done)

6. i will always keep three hours focus time blocked on my calendar to do the work that i have in my mind, prepared — when i was taking a walk or doodling something on my diary or taking shower. the focus time is scheduled after 1.5 hours of waking up and that's when i take caffeine, a tall iced pour over (if you see me drinking citrus or lemon cold brew— i'm having a good time) and mostly i spend my focus time sitting in a cafe.

7. i avoid excessive foods in the morning, a fruit bowl or eggs or oats and honey — that's my breakfast before taking caffeine. i mostly eat veggies in weekdays.

8. till 2 pm is only me, no phone, no meetings— if my phone rings that's an important call or notification.

9. i prefer more actions over motions in the starting of the day and it's play to me because i'm always productive when i'm doing what i love to do and i don't do what i don't love to do and doing more i love— makes me more productive and keeps me on track, if i'm not focused or burnt out— to fix it, i will do something i love which is not a part my work life.

10. my digital consumption is always optimized as per my persuasion. i consume mostly through reading but not excessive, books, newsletters, podcasts and my favorite— people.

11. my average screen time on phone is 1 hr 30 minutes a day during weekdays where— 30-40 minutes on twitter, 20 minutes on mail or on some safari reading tab and 30 minutes gets used in miscellaneous which doesn't involve any consumption or long conversation.

12. i avoid meta products including whatsapp and like to hang out with people who inspire me or i inspire them.

13. i prefer in-person communication and email as best medium to communicate, i love writing emails or receiving emails, some of my closest friends were strangers i decided to message on a whim. — email is the best way to reach me or get something done by me.

14. i do [distributed living](https://oliursahin.com/blog/distributed-living/) — meaning i don't buy things which i can't carry and i stay in hostels, hacker houses, and airbnbs— sometimes with family once or twice in a year— when i'm not on a sprint.
